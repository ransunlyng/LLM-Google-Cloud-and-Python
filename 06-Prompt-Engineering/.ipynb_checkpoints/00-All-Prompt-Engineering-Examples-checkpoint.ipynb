    "\n",
    "In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer, an early analog computer.[12] While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.[13] A paper from this thesis was published in 1938.[14] In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used during that time in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously. Howard Gardner called Shannon's thesis \"possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.\"[15]\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon received his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940.[10] Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in order to develop a mathematical formulation for Mendelian genetics. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Einstein and Kurt Gödel. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.[17]\n",

       "\n",
       "Index investing: Index investing is a strategy in which you invest in an index fund or ETF that tracks an index, such as the S&P 500. This can help you reduce your risk and improve your chances of earning a return on your investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Active vs. passive investing: Active investing is a strategy in which you try to pick individual stocks or bonds that you think will outperform the market. Passive investing is a strategy in which you invest in index funds or ETFs that track an index. Passive investing is generally less risky than active investing, but it can also lead to lower returns.\n",

Their brainchild, Facebook, quickly gained popularity among college students and eventually became a global phenomenon.\n",
